# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

After our first approaching with the data of **PyBer**, we were asked by V. Isualize and our Manager Omar for a new assignment, they want a report based on a database with ride-sharing data by city type that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and generate a multiple-line graph from January to April 2019, this has the purpose of generate information that can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

We started merging the data within the ride and city databases to generate a new one for this analysis, then we select the *the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type* . The database shows that the total fare by type results in $4,327 for the Rural, $19,356 for the Suburban and $39,854 for the Urban cities.

By type, for the Rural cities, they got the least number of rides, in total 125, also the least number of drivers by 78, something interesting is that we have the higher average fare per Ride and Driver in this type of city, $34.62 and $55.49 for each.

For the Suburban cities, they got more rides than the Rural cities, by total 625 with 490 drivers, the average fare per Ride and Driver were fewer in comparison with the Rural cities, they got $30.97 and $39.50 for each category.
The Urban cities has the lowest Fare but, as we mention before, they had the highest total fare, the Urban cities has 1,625 total rides with 2,405 drivers for an average fare per ride and driver by $24.53 and $16.55 each.
 
We also were asked to generate a multiple-line graph from January to April 2019 with the information of the fares by week in this period.

As we saw before, the Urban cities has de highest fare, but from the end of February and the begin of April we can see multiple falls, maybe this had a relation with the spring break period and at the end of April we can see a downfall in the weekly fare, probably the Easter week could have a relation with this.

In the Suburban cities, we can see a similar patter with the Urban cities, but in April we can saw a change of patter with higher fares than the previous month, maybe the Easter week could have relation with this pattern.
The Rural cities, as we saw before, had the lowest fare and the pattern of the series is different from the other two types of cities, maybe we must investigate more about the consumption of the clients and our service.
 
## Summary:

Based on the results, we provide three business recommendations to the CEO:

1.	If we want to have a marketing camping, we must focus on the Urban Cities, we saw a higher Fare in comparison with the other two types of cities.
2.	We must take in account the festivities and holidays in each city, maybe we can offer different kinds of promotions to get more rides and increase the fares of each type of city.
3.	In the case of rural cities, we must develop an investigation about the consumption of the service of PyBer and have an aggressive marketing campaign to increase the amount of Fare in this cities.
